- **Charts**: Libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for interactive charts.
- **Data Table**: Libraries like DataTables or ag-Grid for sorting and filtering.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or any backend technology to fetch live data.
- **Database**: SQL or NoSQL database to store and retrieve data.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up the Project**: Initialize a new project with the chosen frontend framework.
2. **Create Components**: Build reusable components for the header, sidebar, statistics cards, charts, and data table.
3. **Integrate Charts**: Use a chart library to create interactive charts based on live data.
4. **Implement Data Table**: Use a data table library to create a sortable and filterable table.
5. **Style the Dashboard**: Apply the custom color scheme and ensure responsive design.
6. **Connect to Backend**: Set up API endpoints to fetch live data and update the dashboard in real-time.
7. **Testing**: Test the dashboard on various devices and browsers for compatibility.

### Conclusion
This structure provides a comprehensive framework for building a modern, interactive dashboard that can display live statistics, charts, and data tables while ensuring a responsive design and a custom color scheme.
